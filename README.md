Web based artificial intelligence service using crowdsourcing to get information.

This service is written in PHP, and uses HTML for the interface of the frontend.
It uses MySQL for storing data.

# Prequisites
The following are required to install IVAN AI:

MySQL

Adapt Intent Parser (Script for installation included)

A Webserver (Apache, Lighttpd, etc.) (Not neccesary if you will use the AI on only the local machine.)

PHP

Git

Note: If you choose not to install a webserver, you must point your web browser to the location where you told IVAN to install, rather than your ip address, localhost, or your loopback address (most likely 127.0.0.1)

# Installation

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/rplaughlin/ivan-ai.git ~/ivan-ai

2. Run the script to install the Adapt Intent Parser

3. Run the script to install the IVAN AI. Follow the prompts.
